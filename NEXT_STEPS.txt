0500 - FUTURE ROADMAP
=====================

This file outlines planned features for future versions of 0500.
The goal is to eventually launch on Vercel as a public tool.


v1.1 - DATA PERSISTENCE
-----------------------
- Save checked goals to localStorage
- Remember timer history and preferences
- Persist custom schedule across sessions
- Optional: IndexedDB for larger data storage


v1.2 - CUSTOMIZABLE GOALS & SCHEDULE
------------------------------------
- Add/edit/delete goals directly in the UI (no code editing)
- Drag-and-drop to reorder goals
- Add new events to schedule via UI
- Edit event details (title, time, duration, category)
- Delete events from schedule


v1.3 - WEATHER INTEGRATION
--------------------------
- Show current temperature
- Display sunrise/sunset times (relevant to 0500 theme)
- Weather condition icon
- Use OpenWeatherMap API or similar
- Location auto-detect or manual entry


v1.4 - CALENDAR INTEGRATION
---------------------------
- Google Calendar sync (OAuth)
- Apple Calendar support (CalDAV)
- Pull today's events automatically
- Two-way sync: add events from 0500 to calendar
- Color mapping between calendar categories and 0500 types


v2.0 - PUBLIC LAUNCH (VERCEL)
-----------------------------
- User accounts / authentication
- Cloud data sync across devices
- Onboarding flow for new users
- Mobile responsive design
- PWA support (installable app)
- Custom themes (sunrise, sunset, night modes)
- Shareable configurations


TECH CONSIDERATIONS
-------------------
- Current: Single HTML file (simple, portable)
- Future: May need to split into proper app structure for:
  - API routes (calendar OAuth, weather)
  - Database (user accounts, cloud sync)
  - Consider: Next.js on Vercel


DESIGN PRINCIPLES (keep these as we grow)
-----------------------------------------
- Ambient, non-distracting UI
- Warm sunrise aesthetic
- Minimal, spacious layout
- Cinematic typography
- Smooth, subtle animations
- The globe stays central


IDEAS TO EXPLORE
----------------
- Pomodoro statistics / productivity tracking
- Ambient sounds toggle (rain, coffee shop, nature)
- Focus mode (hides everything except timer)
- Daily reflection / journal prompt
- Habit streaks visualization
- Keyboard shortcuts
